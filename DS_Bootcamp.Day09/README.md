## Chapter I

### Foreword

There is real data science and data science for competitions. The difference is the same as
between a porter and weightlifter. A porter can be bad at heavy lifting competitions and
a weightlifter can underperform on a real job. The same is true regarding data science:
in companies, you should have a broader skill set including, for example, soft skills.
You need to understand the business, and to be focused on profit or the organization’s
other goals. But in competitions, you simply need to be really good at achieving the
competition’s target metrics. You may create a super heavy machine learning model that
can be 0.00001 better than the model of your next competitor and nobody cares how long
it takes to make predictions, how interpretable the model is, or how many computational
resources it requires. In business, of course, all these criteria matter.

Nevertheless, you may use competitions for improving your skills. The most popular
platform is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). There are lots of public datasets and competitions. You may even
try to win a prize, but most likely, you will only earn experience, which is not bad at all.
It can be good for building your portfolio. You may organize a team and learn from each
other. You can improve your collaboration skills. The platform allows you to pursue the
machine learning track as well as the data exploration track: whatever you find more
attractive.

So think about it as a great tool for continued growing in the field, but keep in mind
that there are lots of things that are needed in real life besides building machine learning
models and optimizaing hyperparameters.

### Exercise 00 : Regularization

Exercise 00

Regularization

Turn-in directory : ex00/

Files to turn in : regularization.ipynb

Allowed functions : no restrictions

In the previous day, you tried to solve different kinds of machine learning problems
using different algorithms and gained an understanding of the basics. Today, you will try
using more advanced techniques.

Let us start with regularization. Regularization in its broader sense is a technique
that prevents a model from overfitting. As regards logistic regression, we have a formula
with different Xs (features) and coefficients. Regularization penalizes coefficients that are
too big making the formula more robust and more ready for the unknown data that it
will have to work with in the future. L1 regularization makes some coefficients equal to
zero. So this mode may be helpful for feature selection if there are lots of them and you
need to reduce the number. L2 regularization does not make the weights equal to zero
but may make them smaller. We cannot say: use only L2 regularization or L1. In the
field of machine learning, there are not many things that are silver bullets. Usually, you
need to try many different things on your dataset to find what suits it best.

If we talk about trees and forests, regularization is connected to the parameters that
affect the number of cases in the leaves. If your tree is so thick that each leaf includes
only one sample, the chances are that your tree has overfitted to the training dataset.

To prevent that, you can play with such parameters as max_depth, min_samples_split,
min_samples_leaf, max_leaf_nodes, etc.

Many different algorithms have many different parameters of regularization. Our goal
is not to cover them all. You should just know that they exist, and if you need them,
you will understand how they work for a specific algorithm.

In this exercise, you will play with some of them. The dataset will be the same and the
task is still to predict the weekday for each commit with data: uid, labname, numTrials,
and hour of the commit.

What you need to do is fully described in [the notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-bx3kLOrZhe6eGRUj6187SVCglHUyqW5/view).

## Chapter V

### Exercise 01 : Gridsearch

Exercise 01

Gridsearch

Turn-in directory : ex01/

Files to turn in : gridsearch.ipynb

Allowed functions : no restrictions

We are sure that you got tired of iterating through the different parameters of various
models manually. You probably think that there should be a way to automate it. Yes,
there is GridSearch.

You can specify the range of values for the parameters that you want to optimize and
put it to GridSearchCV. It will try all of them, calculate the metrics on cross-validation,
and give you the best combination of parameters as well as the overall results of its
mini-research. That is cool, right?

What you need to do describe in [the notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qH7LmNIrzkH3ViC1aPfnHT5rVKBcEFrQ/view).

## Chapter VI

### Exercise 02 : Metrics

Exercise 02

Metrics

Turn-in directory : ex02/

Files to turn in : metrics.ipynb

Allowed functions : no restrictions

Is 90% accuracy is a good result or not? Actually, it is not easy to say. Imagine a
situation in which you have two classes that are unbalanced: 95% of the samples belong
to the first class and 5% to the second. The accuracy will be worse than a naive classifier
when we make predictions using the most popular class. And this is no fantasy. This
case is quite popular for anti-fraud tasks, for example. The number of fraud cases is
significantly lower than the number of normal cases. Is it a bad metric? What we are
trying to say is that it is simple to understand and you can use it to compare different
models within a task, but this metric can be misleading when you need to compare the
results to a model from another task. Also, it does not say much about the errors. You
just know how many of them there are. But of what kind?

There are some other metrics that can answer this question. They all come from the
[confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix). The first is precision. It is the number of correctly predicted samples
of one class divided by the number of predictions of that class. Imagine that we predicted
10 days as a weekend, but only 7 of them were really weekends. The precision is 0.7.

The second is recall. This is the number of correctly predicted samples of one class
divided by the true number of that class. Imagine again that we predicted 10 days as
a weekend but only 7 of them were really weekends and in the dataset there were 20
weekends. The recall is 0.35 (7/20).

Precision can be good when we want to show an ad that includes some 16+ content.
We want to be precise in our prediction. Recall can be good for identifying terrorists. We
may want to find them all no matter how many civilians experience some inconvenience
along the way. There is also a metric that combines both of them in the harmonic mean
F1 score. You can use it when you need to optimize both of them.

Also, there is the [ROC-curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). When you make predictions, you usually you have
probabilities. And the final classification is ade by comparing them to the threshold. For
example, if we see that, for that given day, the probability of being a weekend is 0.2 and
the threshold is 0.5, we can say that it is not a weekend. But if you change the threshold
to 0.1, the same sample will get the prediction “weekend”. Imagine now, that for each
threshold we calculate recall and also the number of how many working days we predicted
as weekends divided by the real number of working days. We can put both those values
on a plot and we will get the ROC-curve. The higher it is, the better. Comparing curves
can be rather inconvenient. That is why we can use another metric AUC (area under the
curve). Precision, recall, and AUC are useful when we want to compare the performance
of different models from different tasks. And they tell us something about the errors.
Everything that we told you here was connected to binary classification. But it can be
used with some adjustments for multiclass and multilabel classification. You can read
about it [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-i-precision-and-recall-9250280bddc2), for example.

## Chapter VII

### Exercise 03 : Ensembles

Exercise 03

Ensembles

Turn-in directory : ex03/

Files to turn in : ensembles.ipynb

Allowed functions : no restrictions

You already know that a random forest is an ensemble of many different trees. But
actually you can create an ensemble from any type of model. In this exercise, you will
try several approaches: voting classifier, bagging classifier, and stacking classifier. Who
knows, maybe it will help you increase the quality of your predictions.

What you need to do is fully described in [the notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z_DTgLXCNw_uTTjkWMzzFFVJc03xSSc2/view).

## Chapter VIII

### Exercise 04 : Pipelines and OOP

Exercise 04

Pipelines and OOP

Turn-in directory : ex04/

Files to turn in : pipelines.ipynb

Allowed functions : no restrictions

While trying to solve the problem you executed a lot of different actions: prepared
the data, tried different models, tried different metrics, optimized their hyperparameters,
and tried different kinds of ensembles. Now it probably looks a bit chaotic: your code is
in different notebooks that require a lot of scrolling. In this exercise, the last of the day,
you will make it look a bit cleaner, more organized. Why can this be important? In real
life, you may want to share it with your colleagues, you may want to make it a part of
your portfolio or it may be for your own future convenience. The chances are that if you
get back to that code in several months, you will think: who made that mess?

In this exercise, you will try to apply the OOP approach to data analysis. The first
part of your notebook will contain only the imports, classes and methods. The second
part will be your “main program”. You will work with the initial data and you will go
through most of the steps that you executed before.

What you need to do is fully described in [the notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1keRIBgR6CwlEW1QuDMdL37iQ4b54KNno/view).
